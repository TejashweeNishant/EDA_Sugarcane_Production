# 🌾 Global Sugarcane Production: A Data-Driven Analysis

## 🧠 Introduction

Sugarcane is one of the world’s most essential cash crops, playing a pivotal role in sugar production, biofuel generation, and agro-industrial economics. Understanding which countries dominate its production, how efficiently land is used, and how production is distributed across continents can give us fascinating insights into global agriculture.

In this project, I conducted an **end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of sugarcane production data by country and continent. This is my **first data analytics project**, built using **Python, Pandas, and Seaborn**, and aims to demonstrate data wrangling, cleaning, and visualization skills.

## 📊 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to answer the following:

- ✅ Which countries are the top producers of sugarcane?
- ✅ How is production distributed across continents?
- ✅ Which countries have the most efficient yield (Kg per hectare)?
- ✅ Is there any correlation between acreage and production?
- ✅ Are there any outliers or anomalies in the data?

## 📁 Dataset Description

The dataset contains information about **103 countries** and includes the following columns:

| Column Name                  | Description                                |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `Country`                   | Name of the country                        |
| `Continent`                 | Continent the country belongs to          |
| `Production (Tons)`         | Total sugarcane production in metric tons |
| `Production per Person (Kg)`| Per capita production                      |
| `Acreage (Hectare)`         | Land area used for cultivation             |
| `Yield (Kg / Hectare)`      | Efficiency: production per hectare         |

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

The dataset included **non-standard number formats (European style)**, such as:
- Commas as decimal points
- Periods as thousand separators

### 🧼 Cleaning Steps:
- Removed all commas and properly handled multiple periods in numeric strings.
- Converted the following columns from object (string) to float:
  - `Production (Tons)`
  - `Production per Person (Kg)`
  - `Acreage (Hectare)`
  - `Yield (Kg / Hectare)`
- Renamed columns for simplicity.
- Dropped rows with missing values.
- Removed unnecessary index column (`Unnamed: 0`).

✅ This ensured the dataset was fully numeric and ready for analysis.

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 🔹 Distribution by Continent
- Bar chart shows how many countries per continent are included.
- **Asia** had the most countries contributing to sugarcane production.

### 🔹 Histograms (Seaborn Distplots)
- Spread of each numeric column visualized.
- `Production(Tons)` is **right-skewed** — a few countries produce disproportionately more.

### 🔹 Boxplots
- Used to detect outliers in `Production`, `Acreage`, and `Yield`.
- **Brazil** is a strong outlier due to extremely high production.

### 🔹 Violin Plot
- Visualized distribution and density of `Production(Tons)` in one view.

### 🔹 Correlation Analysis
- (Optional heatmap) Could help explore relationships like:
  - Does more land = more production?
  - Which countries are most yield-efficient?

## 🔍 Key Insights

- 🇧🇷 **Brazil** leads global production by a massive margin — over **768 million tons**.
- 🇮🇳 **India** and 🇨🇳 **China** are also major producers but far behind Brazil.
- 🇹🇭 **Thailand** and 🇵🇰 **Pakistan** show high **efficiency per person**.
- **Asian countries** are highly represented in the top 10.
- **South America** leads in **per-country average production**.
- **Yield efficiency varies widely**, indicating differences in technology and agriculture methods.
